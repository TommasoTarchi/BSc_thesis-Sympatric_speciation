# BSc_thesis-Sympatric_speciation

Here you can find all the code and data related to the final thesis for my BSc in Physics at the University of Florence.

The report and all the comments to code are written in **italian** (official language of the BSc).

The aim of the thesis is that of exploring sympatric speciation by numerical simulations. The phenomenon was studied in a context of
both sexual and asexual reproduction, assuming exclusively aploid species and modeling the fitness landscape as the sum of two contributes:
a static one reproducing the interaction with the habitat and a dynamic one reproducing competition between individuals.
