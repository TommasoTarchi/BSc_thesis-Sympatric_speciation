# Sympatric_speciation-BSc_thesis


Here you can find all the code and data related to the final thesis for my BSc in Physics at the University of Florence (2017-2021).

The [report][link1] and all the comments to code are written in **italian** (official language of the BSc).

The aim of the thesis is that of exploring sympatric speciation by numerical simulations. The phenomenon was studied in a context of
both sexual and asexual reproduction, assuming exclusively aploid species and modeling the fitness landscape as the sum of two contributes:
a static one reproducing interaction with the habitat and a dynamic one reproducing competition between individuals.

It was the first time I wrote some code, so please have mercy on me while reading it. Also, it was not intended to become a GitHub repository at all (I didn't even know what GitHub was at that time), so it's a complete mess. However, I'm quite proud of the final result.
